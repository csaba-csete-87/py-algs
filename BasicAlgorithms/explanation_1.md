## Problem 1
### Time Complexity
After we get a couple of corner cases out of the way, we arrive at a recursive function, which is very much like a binary search. 
We are looking for a number, which squared is within a range of values. 
Time complexity is O(n log(n)).
### Space Complexity
We do not create any new data structures here, so Space Complexity will be O(1)
