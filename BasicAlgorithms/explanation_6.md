## Problem 6
We can just simply traverse the array once, and keep a reference to the smallest and greatest values, and update them whenever necessary.
When we are done with the array, we'll just return the touple.
### Time Complexity
Since it is a single traversal, Time Complexity is O(n).
### Space Complexity
Space Complexity scales with number of items in the input list, so it will be O(n)
